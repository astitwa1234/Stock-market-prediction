# stock-market-predictionStock Market Prediction Using LSTM
Overview:
Stock market prediction involves forecasting the future value of stock market indices or individual stocks using historical data. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), can be particularly effective due to their ability to learn from sequences of data and remember important information over long periods.

Key Steps
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Historical Stock Data: Gather historical stock prices (open, high, low, close, volume) from a reliable financial data source (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the data is in a consistent format.
Feature Scaling: Normalize the data using Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling to ensure the neural network trains effectively.
2. Splitting the Data
Training and Testing Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, 80% for training and 20% for testing.
Time Series Data Preparation: Create sequences of data for the LSTM model, where each input sequence corresponds to the stock prices over a fixed time window (e.g., 60 days) and the output is the price at the next time step.
3. Building the LSTM Model
Model Architecture: Define the LSTM network architecture, including the number of LSTM layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and additional Dense layers.
Compilation: Compile the model using an appropriate loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
4. Training the Model
Model Fitting: Train the LSTM model on the training data, using a validation split to monitor the model’s performance on unseen data during training.
Epochs and Batch Size: Experiment with different numbers of epochs and batch sizes to find the optimal training configuration.
5. Evaluating the Model
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualization: Plot the predicted stock prices against the actual prices to visually assess the model’s accuracy.
